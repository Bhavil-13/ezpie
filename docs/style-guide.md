# Ezpie style guidelines

You must follow the style guidelines to make sure that your article fits within the site.

To get started with writing your first article in ezpie, you can copy anyone of the earlier articles and paste them into your article file. Then you can remove every thing from the div tag(**with class as main-body**). Then follow these rules while writing:

- **intro section**: There must be a section(class as intro) with the title of the article and a small description about it.

  - **Title**: The title of the article should be inside the intro section with the _h1 tag with class as head_.
  - **Description**: The description of the article should be inside the intro section below the title, and it must be with the _p tag with class as text_.

- **End line**: At the end of every section, there must be a **hr tag**.

- **Explanation**: There must be an explanation of the topic(if needed) _inside another section with class **what**_

- **Code Examples**: You can use code examples in your articles too. For which, you must use [github gists](https://gist.github.com)

- **Article dependency**: If your article's code example requires some dependencies then you must mention and how to install these dependencies as will.
