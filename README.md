## Why contribute?

You may think that why should I contribute to this website will because ezpie offers you to teach others for free and free for ever! Plus think working on a website all day long just to find that you only wrote 5 webpages! Really annoying right? So help me anyway you want, by making a webpage for any course, sharing ideas you think may help and by making sure there are no grammar errors.
